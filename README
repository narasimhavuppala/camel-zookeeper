This is a component module for Apache Camel to allow interaction with a ZooKeeper Distributed Coordination Cluster (http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/). Like ther rest of the Hadoop project, ZooKeeper requires JDK1.6 and above and thus for the same reasons as the HDFS Component (http://github.com/dgreco/camel-hdfs) this must also live outside of Camel's mainline. That having been said, if you're targetting 1.6 it is ready for use and your feedback is appreciated.

Building
---------
This targets the pending 3.3.0 release of Zookeeper. Until such a time as 3.3.0 is released and a jar is pushed to a Maven repository builds will need to add a jar manually.
A fork of the current Zookeeper head has been made for this purpose and can be obtained via

git clone git@github.com:sgargan/zookeeper.git
cd zookeeper

Use the tag 'camel-zookeeper' to build a jar known to work with the component. 

> git co camel-zookeeper

Build a zookeeper jar with ant

Checkout the latest version of this component

> git clone git@github.com:sgargan/camel-zookeeper.git
> cd camel-zookeeper

Run maven. 

> mvn clean install 

The build will fail due to the missing zookeeper jar but will output the following lines

mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.apache.zookeeper -DartifactId=zookeeper -Dversion=3.3.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file
mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=org.apache.zookeeper -DartifactId=zookeeper -Dversion=3.3.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file -Durl=[url] -DrepositoryId=[id]

use these to install or deploy the zookeeper jar to your local or network repo e.g.

> cd ../zookeeper
> mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.apache.zookeeper -DartifactId=zookeeper -Dversion=3.3.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=build/zookeeper-3.3.0.jar

Rerun your maven build and it should now succeed.

Usage
------

Documentation is in progress. In the interim, consult unit tests for usage.
